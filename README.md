# Simulator-for-Eye-Diagrams-in-PAM-Signaling
This project involves building a MATLAB simulator to generate eye diagrams for binary and 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signaling. The goal is to test the vulnerability of various signaling schemes to intersymbol interference (ISI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) using eye diagrams.
